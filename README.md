# SyBBURD
SyBBURD is a collaborative group project by 4 students at Vanderbilt University, and consists of a bird feeder that classifies and identifies major species populations in the metro Nashville area.
This repository contains the code for the classification model. 
Much credit given to Abishek Anand, as most of the [code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ghostauroragre/resnet18-efficientnet-model-for-classification) was borrowed.
