# SyBBURD
SyBBURD is a collaborative group project by 4 students at Vanderbilt University, and consists of a bird feeder that classifies and identifies major species populations in the metro Nashville area.
\
This repository contains the code for the classification model. \
Much credit given to Abishek Anand, as most of the code, especially the feature transformations, is temporarily [borrowed](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ghostauroragre/resnet18-efficientnet-model-for-classification).
